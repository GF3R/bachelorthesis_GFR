The long-term goal of this Project was first defined in 2017 and has been refined ever since. First and for most, the goal is to create a simple and cheap device(s) which can measure and improve posture. Additional it should all be open source and recreatable. Besides posture, the goal is also to offer a way to improve balance. 
With the idea of improving balance also comes a much larger goal which might not even be achievable. The solutions should be able to find application in the medicinal field, however this seams to be nearly impossible due to the complexity and restrictions in this field. 

Therefore I decided to split the long term goal into smaller steps which should be achievable one by one individually. During this thesis I will try to achieve the following:

Firstly I will need to find out how many Sensors are needed to get an understanding of the users Gait and Position. To Achieve this I will also need to find a way to visualise or interpret the data I am collecting.
