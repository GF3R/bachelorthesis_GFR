\chapter*{Conclusion / Results}
\label{chap:Conclusion}

After more than semester of work, and finally a somewhat usable product, I am looking back at e few very intensive weeks and months. In hindsight, i realise, that my goals were ambitious and almost a bit to high for such a "small" project scope. I have achieved all my goals, but I suspect, my efforts exceed the planned, or credited effort in the "Project 2" module. 
Nonetheless I am very happy with what I have achieved and also do not regret setting the goals so high. The achievements give a great foundation for an interesting and diverse Bachelor Thesis, with a lot of potential.
Furthermore I have chosen a topic which I am highly interested in, which made the extra effort, very easy since it felt more like a hobby. Therefore I am looking forward to my last semester in my Bachelor degree and my bachelor thesis.
