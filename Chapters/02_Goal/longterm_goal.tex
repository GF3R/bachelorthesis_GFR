The Longterm goal of this Project was first defined in 2017 and has been refined ever since. First and for most, the goal is to create a simple and cheap device(s) which can measure and improve posture. Additional it should all be open source and recreatable. Besides posture, the goal is also to offer a way to improve balance. 
With the idea of improving balance also comes a much larger goal which might not even be achievable. The solutions should be able to find application in the medicinal field, however this seams to be nearly impossible due to the complexity and restirctions in this field. 

This goald was created due the lack of opensource and affordable solutions in the medicinal and orthopedic fields. During the refinements and work on this project I found some tools which appear to offer a similar benefit, however none of these are open source or available and most of them have a slightly different application areas (f.E. sports).
