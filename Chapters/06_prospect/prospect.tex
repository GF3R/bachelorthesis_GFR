As mentioned much more has to be achieved, even so, a great base was made with which a lot can be achieved. 

\section{The Next Steps}

The project is not over for me, I see a lot of potential. Theses sensors might have a much wider use case than expected and with my current know-how and more time I might be able to measure more than posture. My partner is a physiotherapist and already had some great ides where these sensors might be used. For example to measure bending of knees and other joints. 

Another quite ambitious goal is to visualise movement with the sensors. I am unsure if this is a possibility since the drift of the measurement could be drastic, however this is something I will definitely try to implement, sine if it is possible would open a lot of opportunities.

A goal which is most likely achievable and I would consider a great improvement is adding an additional sensor as a reference point. This would enable users to wear and track posture even when working in a moving environment. This is probably quite hard to calculate out the movement especially due to synchronisation and latency which I was able to mostly ignore during this project.

Furthermore I will also try out other accelemoters and gyrscopes to determine precision and what would be optimal for my use case. This was not considered, since the MPU6050 does offer enough precision and comparing sensors requires a lot of know-how and time.
